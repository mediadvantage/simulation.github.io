     <h1> Conflict Management Simulation</h1>
	 <h3>Background of the Case</h3>
	 <i>This is a simulation that simulates events and consequences. As you navigate through the simulation,
	 you would see a potential consequence based in the choice you make leading to further choices.
	 For example, event A puts 3 responses. If you choose response 1, there is a consequence which leads to further responses. </i>
	 <br></br>
	 <strong>Here is the scenario:</strong>
	 <i>You are a middle-level manager in an international company. You've been working there since college and have risen up the 
	 corporate ladder through your performance. The company values performance over any other factor. 
	 Your sub-ordinate, Mr. John Smith, recently had posted on his social media account a post that talks about the company 
	 you work for in a negative light. The PR office has caught wind of the post and has given you the responsibility to 
	 deal with it before it becomes detrimental to the firm.</i>

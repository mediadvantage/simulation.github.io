		 <center><a href = "page2.html"><span class ="nowrap"><u>Option 1</u>:<p>Dear John,</p>
<p>It is shameful to see a professional such as yourself put forth yourself and the company in such a light (PFA screenshot below).</p><p> To discuss this, I am arranging a meeting which you need to attend. Please note that this meeting is extremely</p>

<p> critical and your absence will be interpreted as your consent to proceed as per the company legal and ethical guidelines</p>
</span></a></center>

		 <center><a href = "page9.html"><span class ="nowrap"><u>Option 2</u>:<p> Dear John,</p>
<p>It came as a shock to me when I found about the social media post made by you (PFA screenshot below). I want to understand</p> <p>if there is anything that we have done which may have caused such sort of a scenario to happen. I would like to invite you to a</p><p> meeting to discuss more about this.

Note that there is a time crunch on my side and I would like to discuss this at the earliest.</p>

<p>I have been informed quite recently regarding the post that you have posted on Social Media (PFA screenshot below).</p> I would like to invite you to a meeting to discuss more about this.
